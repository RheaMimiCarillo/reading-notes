1. graduate from codefellows

2. looking for work (resume)

- need a stellar resume
  - at a glance, here's someone that's fucking dope
  - qualifying interview

3. call from recruiter

- how do I follow up?
- answer immediately, (if possible)
- set up voicemail! (with a professional message)
  - these are checkboxes the recruiter is looking for

4. technical interview (prep)

- interviews are often phases, where there are multiple interviews and you move on to the next one bit by bit

5. behavioral interview

- as the candidate, you're interviewing the company, as well
  - think of it as getting married in three days: You'll be spending tons of your life with them, and you should be assessing how well they fit in with your values and culture
- and the company wants to see if you have the appropriate soft skills to effectively become the "face" of the company each time you talk with a client or customer
- questions ready
- armed with information about the company, past the surface level
- who are their customers?
- what's the culture like?
- who works there that I can chat with to determine if it's a fit for me?
- can I see myself working here?
- how would I feel, monday morning?
- NOTE: ask at least 5 questions
- "what's the best part of you job?"
- "YOU OWN THAT ROOM when you're in the interview"
  - "you get to decide what you're going to share or not share"

6. JOB OFFER!

-

7. MONEY $$$ (negotiation)

- "we're prepared to offer you $90 K to start...."
  - how do you respond?
  - "i'm excited you feel I'm a good fit for you team. 90K is quite generous and a good starting point. My range is between 90k and 110k. (or, the range for this position is typically....) How open minded are you to negotiation?"
  - companies NEVER offer your the max they have budgeted for their position as their initial offer
  - what other forms of compensation are they offering you? stock options? health? vacation time?
  - when they offer little pay: "oh, I didn't realize it was a part-time position" XD
  - NOTE: Employers EXPECT you to negotiate salary.
    - don't accept their base offering: it's the anchoring effect
  - if they "don't negotiate salary" - "Okay, I understand you don't do salary, but how open are you to time and xyz?" working 2 days on, 2 days remote, 4 day work week, etc

- negotiating

## unlocking the 7 steps

**go-to-market strategy:**

- Personal Brand
  - "Software Developer", primarily
  - in the professional space: use your NAME, (not a nickname)
  - "when I want to meet Rhea Carillo, and they google me, I want them to see the things I've done in the professional space"
- Resume
  - STELLAR
  - just lists technical skills
  - if I want fluffy stuff, make a separate resume
  - there should be no "oh, I wonder what they meant by that"
- Pitch

## Resume

### Translating skills/experiences from past jobs into resume/tech speak

- resumes are not apologies
  - not apologizing for what I've done or not done
  - don't start explaining myself without them prompting me
  - if I've worked a place with multiple jobs, it's all good to condense it!
  - "people aren't studying your resume"
    - they're not just going to read it and magically know about me
    - I want to be comfortable articulating everything on my CV

- don't say "I only worked on this part of this project"
  - but do give attribution to member of my team
  - make forks for group projects and make it your own

- it's a technical resume
  - don't write soft skills
  - the interview should be the place to DEMONSTRATE your soft skills

- in the interview: don't ASK to speak
  - communicate that "I'd like to add to xyz" or such

- in github project repos: Have SOLID readmes
  - you never know if it's a software dev or just a general recruiter who wants to see the pretty colors and design
  - repo link in the resume
  - deployed site in the readme!

- how often to update resume: Any time you're:
- adding new skills,
- experience
- projects,
- to tailor to job posting

- it's a living document
