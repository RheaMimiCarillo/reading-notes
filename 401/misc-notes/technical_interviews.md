# Technical Interviews

## GitHub

A way for recruiters to assess me, asynchronously

## Actionables

- Customize my profile readme
- Keep commit history graph `green`
- Make readme blurb match the energy of my LinkedIn
- Show HIGH Effort! That's going to be someone's first impression of me-

## Post Code Fellows

- Remove references to `labs` and course codes and such
  - ex: rename 'Code Challenge 32' to 'graph-traversal-backwards', or something
  - repo names
  - readme names
  - change the documentation around, so that it makes sense to someone who isn't familiar with the course
  - idea: fork labs and change around documentation and such
  - NOTE: we don't want recruiters to think 'oh, she's just going through course content'
  - We want people to see 'Rhea the Engineer' and less 'Rhea the Student'

## More Best Practices

- Make PRs into my own repos (even on projects I'm not collaborating on)
  - this can show my workflow and discipline
  - and I can go through a project's commit and PR history and talk through my development process

## Repo README tips and best-practices

- Make sure READMEs are more than just boilerplate content
- Describe (be VERY descriptive):
  0: UML, Logo, Picture
  1. What's the project? (doesn't have to be long)
  2. What problem domain does it addresses?
  - even if it's something like: 'I needed a project for class and this project satisfies the requirements'
  3. How do you install it?
  4. How do you run it?
  5. How do you configure it?
  6. What does the UML communicate?\

- Make ***ESPECIALLY*** sure that `pinned` content has excellent documentation
- Goal: concise, elegant, and effective

## README Template

- Requirements - What do you need?
  - Do you need an AWS account?
  - Do you need this paid service?
  - Does do need this specific hardware (Rasp Pi or an RTX 4090)?
- Installation - How do you get this running?
  - ... clone this repo `git clone a;alsdfjk.git`
  - ... put this API key in your  `.env`
  - ... install these dependencies `npm i`
- Usage/Configuration - How do you interact with my program?
  - 'put in a formatted JSON into this box and get a list of results'

## Online Coding Environments

- In a technical interview, code is generally written in plain text
  - Get familiar writing code in the `Notepad` app
