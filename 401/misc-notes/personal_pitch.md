# Personal Pitch

7 steps review

1. graduate from code fellows

2. job search/resume

3. call from recruiter (don't judge the BlackBerry phone)

4. technical interview

5. behavioral interview

6. job offer

7. negotiation

- salary
- benefits
- STARE AT THEM in their eyes
- don't act thirsty
  - say nothing
  - count to 10 in your head
- let them speak first
- then, let them know that "my range is 110k - 140k. let's see where we can land."
- the act of negotiating is a way of "anchoring" your value with an employer. They value you more when you present yourself as an asset and a professional
  - "listen, I know what I'm worth"
  - most people don't negotiate, but companies always expect that SOMEONE is going to negotiate

## Personal Pitches:

- don't overshare
- What do you need to know about people:
  - What's the why behind your why?
    - What drives me?
    - find out, then tell it as a story

- Include:
Background industry or environment'
- prior to being a technologist
- ex: wedding planner

Key strengths and values formed:
-

Where to pitch:

- networking events
- project presentations

Using Pitch for LinkedIn intro

- ask first-degree connections for intros to peeeps
- include my pitch
- address the pitch to the new connection I want to make
- then, all my connection needs to do is cut and paste my intro to the person!

## Intro elements:

- foot in door: "Hi, I heard you talking about xxx project..."

- "my name is: ...", pronouns, where I'm living (Tacoma/Seattle, WA)

WHY did I decide to learn tech in the first place:

- Express my values: "I believe..."
- I'll explain what attracted me to this industry
- I'll explain why I picked THIS specific skill, "I picked this skill, to take advantage of my veteran benefits to learn the fundamentals of programming, and I'd love to (something about learning other coding skills)
- I know the MERN stack (if speaking with a technical person), otherwise, squeeze stuff out

WHAT was I doing before making this pivot?

- what were early indicators that this works for me?

Ideal environment for me, and HOW I'll use this skill

- match MY SKILL to THEIR NEED
- "I heard your xyz... and I'm abc..."
-

- I like being given a problem and having an environment to solve the problem however I want to

Connect with the listener in and out of the pitch

Communicate with my words, body language, and vocal intonation

Signal to the listener that I've finished:

- "and that's why I'm hear today...."
- "

## LinkedIn

- TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS if I'm making changes
  - so that my network doesn't all get bombed with notifications about my updates

- Post often: so that recruiters can see that I'm active and real
  - projects I've done and such

- About: a version of my pitch talking in first person, but with limited use of "I"
  - put summary of languages and skills at the bottom

- Skills section:
  - spend more time on skills of "where I'm going", and not so much of "where I've been"
  - mindset: "I want a job here, what do I need here to communicate that I'm match their need to my self"
  - DO SKILLS TESTS
    - this'll demonstrate that I'm not just talking big game
  - Endorse Classmates skills!
    - ask them to endorse my skills, as well!
  - Promote past collaborators without prompt!
    - be a good connection and lead by example

- Projects section:
  - add links to repo and deployed site
  - HYPERLINK all projects
  - Polish and Professional projects with good README and clean code
  - Connect with other team member's linkedin accounts in the project description
  - what did I build?
  - why did I build it?
  - what are the **key** technologies?

- Expanding network:
  - DO NOT take on someone else's network:
    - build my network from people I know or companies I know
    - Recommend people in my network
    - Who am I following?
    - What companies am I following?
    - Follow Influencers (ughhhhh)

Improving my stuff:

- Ask a classmate: "how's my shit look"
  - What looks great?
  - Where are areas I can improve?

Follow the company and persons page of what I'm interested in!
