# Unlocking the Behavioral Interview

Goal:

Write about your number one takeaway from interviewing a peer today. How does being on “the other side of the table” change your perspective on how you need to approach interviews?

Also write about at least two points of feedback your interviewer gave you during the workshop. What practical steps will you take to sharpen your interviewing skills?

Communicate this energy: I'm here, and I'm ready. You want me to work here, not the other way around.

Answers to stories should have a 'point'.

- A moral or outcome or lesson or something
  - the ability to articulate and effectively communicate
  - Remember! There is a person in front of me, and they have tons of questions to ask, so we need to conversation to flow.

## Interviewer expectations

- interviewing can always be nerveracking
- in-person, we all have tells that gives away how uncomfortable we are
  - Action: figure out what my tells are, then come prepared with a strategy to address each tell
    - example: feet flat on ground tn ,mo address shaking
    - hanky to address sweating
    - think of close up voice idea?
      - oh! bring a warhead to help salivate my whole tongue
  - Action: get to interview site early
    - think of what I want to know, (instead of what they want to know)
    - Remember: I'm interviewing them, too! I'm focusing on that.

How do I illustrate:

get along with difficult people
peer
supervisor
flexible
in stress

"This is what we're thinking in terms of compensation"
"Here's my salary range, is there room for negotiation?"
"Time on site vs time at home "

- succinctly communicate to the interviewer what's important to me and where they could budge to have me come on board
